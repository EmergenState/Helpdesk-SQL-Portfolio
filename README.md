# Helpdesk SQL Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to design and query a relational database using **Microsoft SQL Server 2022** and **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.  
The database simulates a Helpdesk system with three main tables:
- **Customers** – Stores customer details.
- **Agents** – Stores helpdesk agent details.
- **Tickets** – Tracks support tickets, their status, and resolution times.

The project includes:
- Database schema creation scripts.
- Sample data for testing.
- SQL queries for reporting and analysis.
